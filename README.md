   1 week done Data scripting


Data scripting with Python involves using Python programming language to manipulate, analyze, and automate tasks related to data.
Python provides a wide range of libraries and tools for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization, making it a popular choice for data scripting.
With Python, you can transform and manipulate data, automate data analysis processes, generate visualizations,
and integrate with other tools and technologies commonly used in data analysis workflows.
Python scripts can be executed from the command line, allowing for easy automation and integration with other command-line tools or systems.
Python's simplicity and versatility make it suitable for tasks such as cleaning and preprocessing data, merging datasets,
filtering data, performing calculations, and statistical analysis. It also offers libraries like NumPy and Pandas for numerical 
computing and tabular data analysis, as well as libraries like Matplotlib for data visualization. Python scripts can be used for 
automation, allowing you to retrieve data from various sources, process and analyze the data, generate reports or visualizations,
and even deploy machine learning models. Python's extensive standard library and its ecosystem of third-party libraries make it a powerful tool for data scripting.
Overall, data scripting with Python provides a flexible and efficient way to work with data, automate tasks, and gain insights from data analysis.
